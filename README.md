# Data_Extraction_From_Itunes_Log
Creating a Database based off of information in an XML file about Tracks in Itunes for a particular user.  
I was tasked to create a database (we used SQLITE for the SQL lanaguage within python) and then read an XML file which contained infromation about a user's histroy in Itunes
the history included songs, titles, artists, length, albums..etc
then i was tasked to decode that information and parse it so that python can read it.
once I did, I was able to perform some loops that added pieces of information to the appropriate tables created in the database.

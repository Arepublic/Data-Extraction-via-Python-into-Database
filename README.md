# Data_Extraction_From_Itunes_Log
Creating a Database based off of information in an XML file about Tracks in Itunes for a particular user.  
I was tasked to create a database (I used SQLITE SQL to store information and to write in Python) and then read an XML file which contained infromation about a user's histroy in Itunes.
The history included songs, titles, artists, length, albums..etc
Then i was tasked to decode that information and parse it so that python can read it.
once I did, I was able to perform some loops that added pieces of information to the appropriate tables created in the database.
